Overview of the website:

This is a website about a software product. The software itself is performance software for rowers. The website provides detailed help information for existing users. It also explains the features of the software and tries to encourage people to download and use it.

The objectives of the sites are:

	Provide help information for existing users

	Promote this software among individual rowers and coaches

My target audience can be any age range, any genders, any locations, any income level as long as he or she has a smart phone, any education and any occupation. The only thing that matters is he or she is interested in rowing.
